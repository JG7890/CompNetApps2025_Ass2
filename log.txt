commit 6667e492db5cef29c7c74d5aadd89819ece22ff7
Author: JG7890 <a1887235@adelaide.edu.au>
Date:   Tue Apr 22 19:20:20 2025 +0930

    Removed else clause for receiver which processes corrupted packets. SR receiver simply ignores corrupted packets unlike GBN.

    Fixed another code bug. Sender window now slides at max to the intended maximum distance.

    added gbn for oracle submission

    Fixed issue in for loop logic. Now A only slides window as much as the size of the window and does not go past.

    fixed bug with wraparound behaviour for buffer index, tested and no longer segfaults

    Implemented A timer interrupt to resend only oldest packet on timeout.

Date:   Tue Apr 22 15:13:49 2025 +0930

    Implemented A_input() to deal with and interpret ACKs properly for selective repeat. ACKs a packet by setting its seqnum to -1, and window sliding occurs if consecutive ACKed packets from the start of window.

Date:   Tue Apr 22 14:44:11 2025 +0930

    Started sender implementation. Removed ackcount variable, as ACKs are now selective and not cumulative.

    Fixed compile pedantic formatting issues. Also fixed bug in receiver, packets that are delivered are deleted from the buffer by setting its sequence number to -1.

    part 2 of receiver buffering done. slides window and delivers packets to application (layer 5) if it can do so.

Date:   Mon Apr 21 11:20:41 2025 +0930

    first part of receiver buffering done. checks if received packet is within window based on sequence numbers, and buffers packet if so. Also initialise buffer to packets with sequence number of -1.

    Removed B_windowlast, unnecessary as full window size can be used for buffer at all times in SR

    Added back expectedseqnum variable to hold the sequence num of the first window slot, the packet expected to be able to slide window over

    Receiver only sends back a selective ACK if the packet was not corrupted. If it was corrupted, do nothing. If it was not corrupted, send ACK for that packet, whether it was newly received or already buffered, or already delivered (out of window). Also, sequence number for ACK packets is set to the acknum.

    removed B_nextseqnum as B will be sending selective ACKs and can simply use the ACK number as its sequence number.

    prepended A_ to buffer and window variable names for sender, as the receiver (B) should also have its own buffer in SR
